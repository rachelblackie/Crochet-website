    <h1><strong>Crochet</strong></h1>
    <h2><em>Have fun &amp; get creative!</em></h2>
    <p>
      Crochet is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to
      interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials. You can
      make a wide variety of items using crochet: blankets and other housewares,
      plush toys, clothing, accessories, and more! Crochet is also a great way
      to reduce textile waste: Worn-out clothing or linens can be cut into thin
      strips and used to crochet items such as baskets or rugs. Granny squares
      (pictured below) are a common way to use up small amounts of leftover yarn
      from other projects.

      There are many websites offering free patterns for all types of crochet
      items. You can find tutorials on YouTube for many different items, as well
      as for particular techniques. Instagram is great resource - not only for
      inspiration and ideas, but also to connect with other crafters and crochet
      designers. You can purchase patterns on Etsy and support your favourite
      designers.
